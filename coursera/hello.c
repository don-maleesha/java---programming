    /*The code you provided will compile and run, but the value of x printed by printf("%d", x); is undefined. 
    This is because the variable x is declared but not initialized, meaning it contains whatever value happens to be at that memory location at the time of execution.
    In C, local variables (like x in your main function) are not automatically initialized to any specific value.

    The actual value printed can vary between different runs of the program, different compilers, or even different machines.
    It might appear as a seemingly random integer.
    Relying on this undefined value can lead to unpredictable behavior and is considered bad practice. To ensure predictable behavior, always initialize your variables before using them.*/
